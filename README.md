## Process

1. Created the design for the easy job search web app using HTML and CSS.
2. Using Jquery , connected to the HTML document.
   - Grabbed the elements from the HTML page.
   - Using Ajax , USA job APi is called and the top 5 response is displayed on the web page with more job description on one side with the ability to apply for that position .

## Using Easy job Search

To use Easy Job search, follow these steps:

1. Search for any job title with the location inside the united states.

There are so many job sites that it is difficult to go to each site and look for the top jobs that you desire. Our solution and idea for our application was to attempt to bring the top results together on one page. Currently we are only able to pull from the API USA Jobs, after many attemps with other sites, however the design is there. You type in the search field both you desired job title and location and the results populate in card form on the left side of the page. When you click on a card the full job description will then populate on the main portion of the page to the right of the card fields. You can then click on a link that will take you to the job listing on the website that it poplulated from.
