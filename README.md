In this project we were tasked with breaking into developer teams and coming up with our own application from scratch that solves a real world problem. We were to pull information using multiple server-side API requests. We are required to present a MVP to the class with a Power Point presentations. 

Learning Objectives and Requirements:
* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Explain agile software development
* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
* Use a different framwork than Bootstap
* Use 3 server-side API's
* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

Our Project: Easy Job Search
Our dev team decided that our real world problem, and one that we will all soon face in this class, is searching for jobs. There are so many job sites that it is difficult to go to each site and look for the top jobs that you desire. Our solution and idea for our application was to attempt to bring the top results together on one page. Currently we are only able to pull from the API USA Jobs, after many attemps with other sites, however the design is there. You type in the search field both you desired job title and location and the results populate in card form on the left side of the page. When you click on a card the full job description will then populate on the main portion of the page to the right of the card fields. You can then click on a link that will take you to the job listing on the website that it poplulated from.

Future Deployment:
Adding more API's to populate the top job listings and be able to compare these listing at one time in one place. 
Add more search options including a desired salary options. 
Add a save funtions so that you are able to save the job listings that you are interested in.
